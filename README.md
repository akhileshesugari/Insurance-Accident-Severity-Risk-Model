# Insurance-Accident-Severity-Risk-Model
Machine learning–based insurance risk model using Random Forest to predict accident severity from driver demographics, vehicle attributes, and residential data. Designed to enhance underwriting accuracy, risk profiling, and data-driven premium pricing decisions.
This project develops a machine learning–driven risk assessment model designed to predict accident severity for insurance applications. Using structured accident data that includes driver demographics, vehicle characteristics, and residential area information, the model identifies patterns that influence the likelihood of severe accident outcomes.

The primary objective is to enhance insurance underwriting accuracy and support data-driven premium pricing strategies. Traditional risk evaluation often relies on historical averages and rule-based frameworks. In contrast, this project applies advanced predictive modelling techniques to uncover complex relationships between demographic, environmental, and vehicle-related factors.

The workflow begins with data preprocessing, including cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to understand key trends and correlations across variables such as driver age, vehicle type, location category, and accident severity.

A Random Forest classifier is implemented as the core predictive model due to its robustness, ability to capture non-linear relationships, and strong performance on structured datasets. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix analysis to ensure reliability and generalisability.

Beyond technical implementation, this project demonstrates clear business impact. The predictive framework enables insurers to improve risk profiling, identify high-risk segments, optimise pricing strategies, and strengthen decision-making processes. By transforming raw accident data into actionable risk intelligence, this solution highlights the practical integration of machine learning within the insurance domain.
